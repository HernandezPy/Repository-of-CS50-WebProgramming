# Going to the Dentist.
#### Video Demo: <https://youtu.be/URZ6zilNmnU>
#### Description:
My project is based on a data table which has options of services that a dentist offers to his patients. Then each service has its own cost, and according to the client's selection it will receive a 50% discount. If the client decides to pay immediately the discount will be applied and if decides not to pay, the full service will be applied. My code consist of the main function where I created a dictionary with a variable called data, where the "options", "services" and "the cost" are placed, then with the tabulate library it defines the table_of_information function to give a more attractive appearance to the output. Then it defines the job_cost function which asks the client to select one of the services and according to the input it will receive the information of its selection, and finally defines the discount_in_advance function which has the function of printing a message telling the client that if it pays in advance it will receive a 50% discount. It also receives an input if wishes to pay [yes/no] if the client decides to pay in advance the discount will be applied and if not it will pay the full amount.
